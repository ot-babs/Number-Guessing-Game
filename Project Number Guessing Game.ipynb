This project has two types of requirements:\n","\n","### Technical Requirements:\n","Technical Requirements are designed to guide you on your project. These will help point you in the right direction as well as show you what we will be looking for when reviewing your project. These requirements will be focused towards the specific coding aspects you use.\n","\n","### Functional Requirements:\n","Functional Requirements are designed to provoke thought throughout your project. These will be based in theory rather than code. These requirements will assist in shaping your output of each task.\n","\n","#### Make sure to read all of the instructions at least twice.\n","\n","<hr style=\"border:2px solid\">\n","<h1 style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 3em;\">Project Requirements</h1>\n","<hr style=\"border-top:1px dashed\">\n","\n","### Functional Requirements:\n","Your task is to create a game in which you generate a random number and compare it to a user's input. If the user guesses the random number correctly they win! If they do not guess it correctly within three attempts they lose.\n","\n","- Tell the user the number range they will be guessing within\n","- Ask the user for an input\n","- Print what they answered and state if it is correct or incorrect\n","- Then print whether or not it is higher or lower\n","- If it is incorrect, allow user to guess a total of 3 times\n","- If they are out of guesses or have guessed the correct number Print out their guesses and the correct number\n","- Ask the user if they want to play again\n","- If they decide to stop playing, output the number of attempts and correct guesses\n","\n","\n","### Code Requirements:\n","This project will require an assortment of counter variables that will have to be set on a global scale (they exist outside of all functions). It will also be required to use at least one function that you write. I would recommend you create the barebones of the game, then pretty it up. Do not worry about making incredibly detailed print statements and formatting until you finish the base game.\n","\n","- Import the ``random`` library to create random numbers\n","- Write at least Two function\n","- Check the user input for any types of non-numeric answers\n","- Use several global counters to keep track of user's statistics\n","- Code must have comment's explaining what you did\n","\n","\n","<hr style=\"border:2px solid\">"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["---\n","\n","### Part One:\n","> Please write in pseudo code a list of steps that your code will do\n","\n","> These do not need to be overly detailed.
